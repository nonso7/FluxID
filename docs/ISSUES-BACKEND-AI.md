# Backend & AI Issues - FluxID

This document tracks backend infrastructure and scoring logic for FluxID.

Core Principle:
The backend exists to do ONE thing:

> Turn wallet transaction history into a trust score.

Everything else supports that.

## Phase 1: Data Ingestion (Minimal Pipeline)

### Issue #BK-1: Transaction Data Fetching

**Category:** [DATA]  
**Status:** PENDING  
**Priority:** Critical

**Description:** Fetch wallet transaction data from Stellar.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Setup Node.js service (lightweight)
- [ ] Connect to Horizon API
- [ ] Fetch recent transactions for a wallet
- [ ] Extract payment operations only
- [ ] Classify:
  - Inflow (incoming funds)
  - Outflow (outgoing funds)

**Notes:**

- Do NOT overbuild ingestion pipeline
- Only fetch what is needed for scoring

---

### Issue #BK-2: In-Memory Processing (No Heavy DB)

**Category:** [INFRA]  
**Status:** PENDING  
**Priority:** Critical

**Description:** Process transactions without heavy infrastructure.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Process transactions in-memory
- [ ] Normalize data (amount, timestamp, type)
- [ ] Optional: lightweight caching (Redis or in-app)

**Notes:**

- Avoid full database setup for MVP
- Speed > persistence for demo

---

## Phase 2: Scoring Engine (CORE LOGIC)

### Issue #BK-3: Rule-Based Liquidity Score

**Category:** [AI]  
**Status:** PENDING  
**Priority:** Critical

**Description:** Compute wallet trust score (0–100).

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Inflow consistency:
  - Detect regular income patterns
- [ ] Outflow stability:
  - Detect erratic vs controlled spending
- [ ] Transaction frequency:
  - Measure activity level
- [ ] Combine into final score (0–100)

**Output:**

- `score: number`

**Notes:**

- Keep logic simple and explainable
- No ML for MVP

---

### Issue #BK-4: Risk Classification

**Category:** [AI]  
**Status:** PENDING  
**Priority:** High

**Description:** Convert score into simple risk level.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Define thresholds:
  - Low: > 70
  - Medium: 40 – 70
  - High: < 40
- [ ] Generate short explanation string

**Output:**

- `risk: Low | Medium | High`
- `insight: string`

---

## Phase 3: API Layer (Demo Critical)

### Issue #BK-5: Core Score Endpoint

**Category:** [API]  
**Status:** PENDING  
**Priority:** Critical

**Description:** Serve score to frontend.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Setup Express or Fastify server
- [ ] Endpoint: `GET /score/{wallet}`
- [ ] Response format:

```json
{
  "score": 82,
  "risk": "Low",
  "insight": "Consistent inflow and stable spending",
  "suggestion": "Consider saving a portion of incoming funds"
}
```

Add basic caching (optional)

**Notes:**

- This endpoint powers the entire demo
- Must be fast and reliable

---

## Phase 4: Suggestions Engine (Lightweight)

### Issue #BK-6: Recommendation Logic

**Category:** [AI]  
**Status:** PENDING  
**Priority:** Medium

**Description:** Generate simple behavioral suggestions.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Rule-based suggestion system
- [ ] Limit to 1–2 suggestions per wallet
- [ ] Keep language simple and human

**Examples:**

- "Your spending is inconsistent — try stabilizing outflows."
- "You receive funds regularly — consider saving a fixed portion."

---

## Phase 5: Optional Integration (If Time Allows)

### Issue #BK-7: Smart Contract Sync

**Category:** [INTEGRATION]  
**Status:** PENDING  
**Priority:** Medium

**Description:** Push computed score to Soroban contract.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Call set_score(wallet, score)
- [ ] Sync backend → on-chain storage
- [ ] Handle failures gracefully

**Notes:**

- Not required for demo
- Only implement if time permits

## Phase 6: Agentic AI Payments (X402 Integration)

### Issue #BK-8: 402 Payment Middleware

**Category:** [AI / PAYMENTS]  
**Status:** PENDING  
**Priority:** High  

**Description:** Enable pay-per-request API access using Stellar payments.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Intercept protected endpoints (e.g. `/score/{wallet}`)
- [ ] Return HTTP 402 if payment not detected
- [ ] Include:
  - payment address
  - required amount
- [ ] Store pending payment requests

---

### Issue #BK-9: Payment Verification (Stellar)

**Category:** [BLOCKCHAIN]  
**Status:** PENDING  
**Priority:** Critical

**Description:** Verify incoming payments on-chain.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Listen for incoming transactions (Horizon)
- [ ] Match payment:
  - wallet
  - amount
  - memo/reference
- [ ] Mark request as paid
- [ ] Allow access after verification

---

### Issue #BK-10: Agent Retry Flow

**Category:** [AI]  
**Status:** PENDING  
**Priority:** High

**Description:** Enable seamless retry after payment.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Store request state temporarily
- [ ] Allow re-request without re-triggering 402
- [ ] Return cached result after payment

---

### Issue #BK-11: Paid Endpoint Wrapper

**Category:** [API]  
**Status:** PENDING  
**Priority:** High

**Description:** Wrap scoring endpoint with payment requirement.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Protect `/score/{wallet}`
- [ ] Only return result if:
  - payment verified OR
  - request is free-tier (optional)
- [ ] Return structured response for agents

---

### Issue #BK-12: MCP / Agent Compatibility (Optional Boost)

**Category:** [AI]  
**Status:** PENDING  
**Priority:** Medium

**Description:** Make FluxID usable by AI agents via MCP.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Define tool schema:
  - `analyze_wallet(wallet_address)`
- [ ] Return structured JSON
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with:
  - Claude
  - Gemini
  - ChatGPT agents

## Final Guideline

For hackathon success:

Backend must be:

- Fast
- Simple
- Reliable
- Demo-ready

Not:

- Complex
- Overengineered
- Feature-heavy

## Success Metric

During demo:

- Wallet is analyzed instantly
- Score is returned correctly
- Insight is understandable
- No API failures
```
