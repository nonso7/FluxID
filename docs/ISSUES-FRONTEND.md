# Frontend Issues - FluxID

This document tracks UI/UX and integration tasks for the FluxID dashboard.

Core Principle:
The UI must make one thing obvious in under 3 seconds:

> "This wallet has a trust score."

Everything else supports that.

### Issue #FE-19a: Address Input as Primary Entry

**Category:** [UX]
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Priority:** CRITICAL

**Description:**
Make wallet address input the main way users interact with FluxID.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Add wallet input field (hero section)
- [x] Add "Analyze Wallet" button
- [x] Validate Stellar address format (regex `^G[A-Z2-7]{55}$` + inline warning on bad input)
- [x] Call backend endpoint (`GET /score/:accountId`)
- [x] Render results immediately

**UI Behavior:**

- Input is PRIMARY (always rendered, no wallet gate)
- Wallet connect is SECONDARY (optional "Use my wallet" / "Connect Freighter to autofill" affordance)
- Hint: "No signature needed — scoring uses public on-chain data"

**Notes:**

Removed the prior hard redirect to `/` when Freighter not connected — the page now
renders and functions for any visitor. Aligns with infrastructure positioning: platforms,
agents, and remittance apps can score wallets they don't own.

**Evidence:** `frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx`, added Stellar regex validator, Enter-key
submit, and removed `isConnected` gating.

## Phase 9: Agent Payment Visualization (Demo Booster)

### Issue #FE-19: Payment Flow UI (402 Simulation)

**Category:** [UI/AI]  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Priority:** High

**Description:** Visualize agent payment flow for demo clarity.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Show "Payment Required" state with locked score placeholder
- [x] Display amount, payment wallet address, and memo (copyable)
- [x] "Signing..." and "Processing payment..." states during Freighter approval + Horizon submit
- [x] Transition to "Access Granted" with animated score reveal

**Evidence:** `frontend/app/components/AgentDemo.tsx`, `frontend/lib/agentDemo.ts`, route `/dashboard/agent`. Uses a real HTTP 402 response from the backend's `/paid/score/:accountId` endpoint and a real Freighter-signed Stellar payment.

---

### Issue #FE-20: Agent Activity Panel

**Category:** [UI/AI]  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Priority:** Medium

**Description:** Show what the AI agent is doing in real time.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Activity log UI with six steps:
  - "Requesting score..."
  - "Payment required"
  - "Signing payment with Freighter"
  - "Submitting payment to Stellar"
  - "Retrying request after payment"
  - "Score received"
- [x] Step status (pending / active / done / error) with live icons and detail lines
- [x] Auto-advances as the real X402 flow progresses (no simulation)

**Evidence:** `frontend/app/components/ActivityLog.tsx`, consumed by `AgentDemo`.
